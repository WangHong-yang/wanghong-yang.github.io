						<h4>Talk</h4>
						<p class="title">Video Captioning: Bridging Video and Language with Deep Learning</p>
						<p>The recent advances in deep learning have boosted the research on video analysis. For example, convolutional neural networks have demonstrated the superiority on modeling high-level visual concepts, while recurrent neural networks have been proven to be good at modeling mid-level temporal dynamics in the video data. We present a few recent advances for understanding video content using deep learning techniques. This talk will focus on translating video to language, which is one of the ultimate goals of video understanding in the computer vision and multimedia research. Specifically, we will present recent work bridging video and language with joint embedding and translation, which achieves the best to-date performance in this nascent vision task. We will also talk about our new dataset and future directions for video and language.</p>
